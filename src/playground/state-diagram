    //so whenever the data changes, we need to update it, and re-render the application, that maintains the component state
    //state is just an object with key-value pair
    //we can change the value by interacting with the page with actions


    //5 things essential to make sure component state works::
    //1. Setup default state object
    //2. Component rendered with default state values
    //3. Change state based on event
    //4. Component re-rendered using new state values
    //5. Start again at 3.
